contains the openLUD Open Binary Interface (OBI) files

    these are directly interfaced and ran natively, but are compiled into bytecode.
    do note that this is NOT a programming language, nor is it a compiler. this
    handles direct native execution of OBI files.

    see the provided diagram for more details

tips:
    - make sure you are running the latest version of openLUD
    - when processing high amounts of data (larger than 256 bytes), it is good
    to utilize more than 1 register. the maximum amount of physical data OpenLUD
    can hold is 256^2 (or 65536 real bytes).
